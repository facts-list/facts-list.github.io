  <p>This website serves to highlight the amazing work done by dedicated individuals and organizations across the world to create Freely Available Computer Technology Standards.</p>

  <p>All kinds of computer-technology standards are included this collection. Some standards are &quot;voluntary consensus standards&quot; developed under the auspices of a formal standards-development organization. Other standards are developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization">nonprofit organizations</a>, industry consortia, individual companies, government entities, or any number of other legal or informal associations of experts and other stakeholders. For additional background, see Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard">Technical standard</a>.</p>

  <p>To the eligible for listing here, a standard must be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A technical standard related to computer technology (hardware and software interfaces, network protocols, file formats, and so on).</li>
    <li>Freely available for download (legally).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that a standard is more than product documentation, no matter how good that documentation may be, because a standard is intended to enable multiple, independent implementations of the standardized behavior. If you are interested in learning more about best practices for standards development, you might find <a href="https://open-stand.org/">Open Stand</a>'s website useful.</p>

  <p>Neither this website, nor any of its authors or contributors, make any representations regarding any intellectual property relevant to any of the listed standards. If you are unfamiliar with intellectual property, you might find Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual property</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing</a> (which sometimes applies to standards-relevant intellectual property) useful.</p>
